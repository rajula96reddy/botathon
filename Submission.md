Other improvements we would suggest are:
- For the JSON API, only GET requests are being allowed for now. But for developers like us, having other types of requests like PUT, POST, etc., would be very useful.
- Allowing developers to post videos and audio clips from youtube or any other streaming platforms would be very useful.
- Being able to download the FAQ's and Paths in a readable format like in other platforms (API.ai)
